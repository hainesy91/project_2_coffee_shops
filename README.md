# project_2_coffee_shops

This is the second project that we have been asked to do.

The idea for my project is to create an app for reviewing coffee shops and coffee types. The user can visit the site and will be presented with the option to 'Add a new Coffee Shop, View a list of Coffee Shops and Review a Coffee Shop'. 

I initially had the idea of being able to add everything right from the home page, which would of been divided into four sections. Add a Coffee Shop, Add a Coffee Type, Review a Coffee Shop and View Coffee Shops. 

However, after building the seperate functionality for each of these methods to work, I encountered diffculty trying to inplement the functionality all from the home page. I had issues trying to get the id's of the coffee shop to attach the coffee type's and reviews to.

I then thought about my site from a more user focused perspective and realised that they would be more likely to look for a coffee shop than to add one. So I decided to change my approach and make the website about finding coffee shops. To do this, I decided to add in a search bar feature which I did by installing the ransack gem.

This added additional problems but after struggling with the code for a whole I was able to get it to work. I could then build in the features that I had already created in around this. So if a user searched for a coffee shop and they were unable to find the one that they were looking for, they would be then be able to add that coffee shop to the list/database. From the coffeeshop page, a user can then add what kinds of coffee they serve at that particular shop, and they can add a review for that particular shop which is what I have been able to produce as my final MVP.

If I had more time, I would of liked to have included a maps API like google, to show the coffee locations on a map. I would also have liked to have been able to add user logins, the ability to add photos to the coffee shops and have user's be able to edit information with a validation system in place.
